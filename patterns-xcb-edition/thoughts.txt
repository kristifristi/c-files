 so, in order to be able to check where I am, I NEED to use ints because I cant trust floats with equality
 do I scale those ints?
 I don't really see why not.
 but, of course, I will be drawing patterns in n^2 time. is it that bad? not yet.
 I was thinking of storing every possible line as a float, but xpoints don't have floats. I think I'll just make upscaled versions, multiply by size, then divide by upscale factor.
 
 start:
 	store the first point
 	draw the first line +exit indicator
 	get the second point
 loop:
 	draw the enter indicator of the previous line
 	update the angle
 	draw the next line and its exitindicator
 	get and store the next point
 	update the visits
